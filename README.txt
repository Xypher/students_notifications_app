during the last few months we faced many difficulties in our online education such that, lecture communicate, examination dates, announcements, the bad infrastructure that we are depend on like Elearning, so students get cunfused by many exams and projects and multi dead lines another huge problem that inorder to know if there is any update to a dead line or exammination dates you must open your browser and login into elearning you have to do this opreation many times during the day inorder to get annonsed, this is exsosting in many ways.

so we  come up with an idea that can solve many issues in one time the solution in few words is we give students a notification whenever there is an  update or just a reminder in our structure student has to login to an android app using university email then like a magic every thing is ok student can attend any class that he want teacher can add any student also teacher is the only one that he can write a notification to a class
